# For the non-interactive plotter, there are two required flags:

      -i #The CID (or comma separated CIDs) you want to plot
      -v #The version of your sim

#Then there are some optional flags:
      
      -b #The bin size for spectra plotting, default is to plot the raw data
      --lc #Just plot the light curve, ignore spectrum
      --spec #Just plot the spectrum, ignore light curve

#Overall, your command should look something like this at minimum:
	  
	  python plot_snana_sim.py -i CID -g MY_GENVERSION


#Example:

	 python plot_snana_sim.py -i 2001en,2002de -v DES-SN3YR_LOWZ
